# Contributing to firejailed-tor-browser

Welcome to firejailed-tor-browser, and thanks for taking the time to contribute!

TL;DR: open issues, comment on issues, open PRs.

## What does "contributing" mean?

There are many ways to contribute to an open source project, including:

- Updating or correcting documentation
- Feature requests
- Submitting bug reports

But you aren't limited to these things. Use your imagination. If you like a project, and you see something that can or should be improved, then you have an opportunity (but not an obligation) to contribute.

### Improve documentation

As a user of `FTB` you're the perfect candidate to help us improve our documentation. Typo corrections, error fixes, better explanations, more examples, etc. Open issues for things that could be improved. Anything. Even improvements to this document.

### Improve issues

Some issues are created with missing information, not reproducible, or plain invalid. Help make them easier to resolve. Handling issues takes a lot of time that we could rather spend on fixing bugs and adding features.

### Give feedback on issues

We're always looking for more opinions on discussions in the issue tracker. It's a good opportunity to influence the future direction of `FTB`.

## Why should I contribute?

Regardless of the details, being an effective contributor means that you're adding _adding value_ to a project.

Here are just a few of the advantages of adding value to a project:

- you gain the appreciation and respect of the project's maintainers and community
- you gain valuable experience
- you get noticed by job recruiters
- you become more attrative to potential employers.
